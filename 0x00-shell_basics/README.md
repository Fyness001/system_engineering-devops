# 0x00 Shell Basics

Welcome! This directory contains a collection of shell script files created as part of my System Engineering & DevOps learning journey.

Each script here performs a specific task related to basic shell commands, such as navigating directories, listing files, working with paths, and understanding the Linux file system.

All scripts are written in Bash and start with the required `#!/bin/bash` line for proper execution.

This is the foundation of mastering the command lineâ€”a key skill for any DevOps engineer!
